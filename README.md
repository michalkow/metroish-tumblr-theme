##About

Finally I grew tired of my default Tumblr theme and I decided to do my own. 
I did build it on modified version of Cosmo Bootstrap from Bootswatch - I did mostly change the brand colors and modified inverse version of navbar.
It is first time I worked with Tumbler markup. 
I didn't manage to implement all the features that it offers, as I don't use/want some of them, but I might add them in the future for others. 
Feel free to help me and fork it ;)
